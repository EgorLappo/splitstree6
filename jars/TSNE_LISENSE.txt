The TNSE jar contains classes from EJML.

EJML has been developed most by Peter Abeles in his spare time.
Additional thanks should go towards the Institute for Human Machine Cognition (IHMC) which encouraged the continued development
of EJML and even commissioned the inclusion of the first few complex matrix operations after he had left.
HEBI Robotics sponsored the continued developement of support for sparse matrix operations, a much needed feature.
All the feedback and bug reports from its users have also had a significant influence on this library.
