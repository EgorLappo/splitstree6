THE PLAN

Add better output, so it is easy to tell exactly which versions of the algorithms are being called and how many iterations/seconds they take.
-> Have added output to matlab scripts. In the process of adding output for the projected gradient calculations each iteration of the block pivot and Active set/


Study bees.nex again, to see if it is an implementation or algorithm error
-> Implementation error. 

Create a dataset with around 50 taxa, restricted from one of Oliviers
-> Needed a larger one. Have created one with 100 tax.

TODO:
1. Check code of Active set - there seems to be a mixup between x and old_x.
2. Complete implementation of pg plotting for Active set and block pivot.
3. Side by side comparison of Code in ST4 with the new code. What options will make them produce identical code?
4. Determine times / residual as a function of |G|, nTax.
